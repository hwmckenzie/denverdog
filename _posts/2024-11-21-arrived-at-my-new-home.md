A big change in my life today. 

A little while ago one of the small humans in my first family fell on me. My new family told me they are surprised this didn't happen sooner because apparently I am always under foot. It did hurt at the time, but I didn't really think about it too much. But my first family was worried so they took me to the vet. I got some photos taken and stayed a night at the clinic. Then a different human picked me up and I went on a car ride somewhere different. The next day another different human came to get me and brought me to my new home. I'm not realy sure why I'm here, but the two humans who live here seem very nice.

There are a lot of dogs in this house! One of the humans sat with me in a kennel so I could get used to the resident dogs without being too crowded. I met Revi, who is the friendliest. Then I met Sadie who is very old and a bit grumpy. Next was Riblet. I think Riblet might be fun, but she seems a bit stand-offish so far. Last I got to meet Seuss, who is a very big Shepherd dog (like me!) and who is a bit scary and seems to own all the toys.

I'm a bit confused about where my first family is and why I'm living here now, but it seems ok. I am all tucked in for the night in a crate right beside the humans' bed, so I think it will be ok.
